# 😀 About Me

Hi, there! I’m a master student in the School of Cyber Science and Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), co-supervised by Prof. [Haoyu Wang](https://howiepku.github.io/) & [Kailong Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WpOnslgAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I received my B.S. degree at Xidian University, under supervision of Prof. [Hui Li](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/lihui/index.html) in June 2023. 

I am interested in improving the security of mobile systems and having an impact in the real world. My current research interests include Mobile Security (Especially Mini-Programs), OSS Security and LLM Security:

- Mobile Security: Super/Mini App Security
- OSS Security: Supply Chain Poisoning
- LLM Security: Jailbreak、LLM4Security

If you would like to reach me, please send an email to [shenaowang@hust.edu.cn](shenaowang@hust.edu.cn)
