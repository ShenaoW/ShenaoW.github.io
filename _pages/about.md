# 😀 About Me

Hi, there! I’m a master student in the School of Cyber Science and Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), supervised by Prof. [Haoyu Wang](https://howiepku.github.io/). Previously, I received my B.Eng. degree at Xidian University, under supervision of Prof. [Hui Li](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/lihui/index.html) in June 2023. 

I am interested in the intersection of security, program analysis, and AI systems. To understand and mitigate evolving system security & privacy threats, I work to design and develop practical tools with program analysis techniques to detect and defend against a wide range of vulnerabilities in various systems, e.g. OSS supply chain, universal endpoint, LLM infrastructure and other AI systems. 

- OSS Supply Chain: NPM/PyPI Code Poisoning (ASE'23, ASE'24)
- Universal Endpoint: ransomware (CCS'24), miniapp security (ASE'23) & privacy (SE 2030)
- LLM Infra: pre-trained model supply chain (ASE'24, SE 2030)

If you would like to reach me, please send an email to [shenaowang [AT] hust.edu.cn](mailto:shenaowang@hust.edu.cn).

Here are my close friends' homepages: [Xinyi Hou](https://xinyi-hou.github.io/), [Yanjie Zhao](https://yanjiezhao96.github.io/), [Liu Wang](https://liuer-wang.github.io/), [Ningke Li](https://ningke-li.github.io/).
