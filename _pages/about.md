# 😀 About Me

Hi, there! I’m a master student in the School of Cyber Science and Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), supervised by Prof. [Haoyu Wang](https://howiepku.github.io/). Previously, I received my B.Eng. degree at Xidian University, under supervision of Prof. [Hui Li](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/lihui/index.html) in June 2023. 

I am interested in improving the security of mobile systems and having an impact in the real world. My current research interests include Mobile/Web Security, OSS Security and LLM Security:

- Mobile/Web Security: WebView-based Apps
- OSS Security: NodeJS/PyPI Code Poisoning
- LLM Security: Pre-trained Model Supply Chain Security, LLM4Security

If you would like to reach me, please send an email to [shenaowang [AT] hust.edu.cn](mailto:shenaowang@hust.edu.cn).

Here are my close friends' homepages: [Xinyi Hou](https://xinyi-hou.github.io/), [Yanjie Zhao](https://yanjiezhao96.github.io/), [Liu Wang](https://liuer-wang.github.io/), [Ningke Li](https://ningke-li.github.io/).
